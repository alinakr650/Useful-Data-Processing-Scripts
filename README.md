# Useful-Data-Processing-Scripts

A number of scripts I've written for my use-cases over the years.

1. docx-merger.py - I needed to jam loads of .docx files in one with pictures, graphs, etc for further processing. Put together a quick script to make that happen.
   How to use: ```python merge_docs.py "/Path/to/your/directory" combined_output.docx```
